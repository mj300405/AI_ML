This is a repo with some of my project i have been doing in my free time.

Flappy Square is a Flappy Bird like app. However Reinforcement Learning (QNet) have been implemented to let the agent play it itself.

LeNet_Fasion is implementation of LeNet neural network for FasionMNIST dataset.

MNIST_scratch is an implementation of a neural network and all the functions using numpy and pandas.

MachineLearningFromScratch are impoementations of basic Machine Learning model such as SVM, linear regression or logic regression.

ResNet-50_FGVCAircraft is an implementation of a CNN residual neural network but used on a Aircraft dataset, because of calculation limitations.

Snake+AI is againg an reinforcement learning model that this time learns how to play game of snake.

Titanic_Kaggle contains my struggles to choose the best model for popular Titanic dataset.
